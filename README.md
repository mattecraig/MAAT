# The Multi-Assumption Architecture and Testbed (MAAT) modelling system. #



The multi-assumption architecture and testbed (MAAT) is a modelling framework designed to facilitate simple and rapid comparison of multiple modelling hypotheses and assumptions, i.e. ways in which to represent processes, in a systems context.
MAAT is designed to easily specify and run large ensembles of simulations.
Ensembles can vary in process representation, parameter values, and environmental conditions.
Built in sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification (SA/UQ) can be used to assess variability in model caused output by multiple ways in which to represent processes. 
Built in MCMC can be used for parameter estimation in a particular model configuration. 

The MAAT framework is a model wrapper and a model coding syntax that can be used to define a model of a system.
The wrapper and the system model are separated and the syntax allows the wrapper to pass system-model specific information to the model without any system-model specific information contained in the wrapper. 
All system-model specific information is contained within the system model and initialisation files. 
This separation of wrapper and system model allows rapid development of new system models and system model components (e.g. process representations) without the need to edit the wrapper.

Current systems models that come packaged with the MAAT are a leaf-scale model of photosynthesis, a simple ground-water model detailed in Dai et al (2017 WRR), and a simple 'Hello World' type example and template for building new system models. 

MAAT is written in R and uses the object oriented programming package 'proto' to develop the wrapper and model objects. 
MAAT has been developed on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS Catalina.
MAAT is designed to be run from the command line (and in some instances from within the R console or IDE like Rstudio).

### version 1.3 ###

* MCMC DREAM and DREAM-ZS algorithms (Vrugt, 2016) for parameter estimation working, including restart.
* MCMC parameter priors now use code snippets in same way as SA/UQ.
* A number of bug fixes.
* Semi-analytical solver functions, still a work in progress.
* Canopy struncture system model developments, still a work in progress.

#### version 1.3.1 ####

* Sphagnum LAI functions now in canopy_structure object.
* Met and obs data now passed through an MCMC restart.


### Use guidelines ### 

If you want to use this code then please do! 
If you plan to publish using this code, communicating your intentions with code authors at an early stage is the use-policy (i.e. when the study is being designed and simulations are being run, well before manuscript drafting).

Please be respectful of other people's work and their willingness to open source their code. 
The master branch is very close to the cutting edge developments in MAAT, which allows for good code integration and software best practice. 
Please be aware that the authors of these developments are likely to have not yet published what they are intending to, please contact them to discuss use. 
Older code is fine to use without co-authorship, but it is rcommended that code authors be contacted. 
This is a balance, and likely no single rule really fits all situations. 
So get in touch and we'll work something out that's agreeable to all parties.
